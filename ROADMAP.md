## **Development Status**

ASIOS™ is currently in its early stages of development. We’ve made progress with our **custom kernel** config, optimized specifically for AI workloads. 

**The first early-stage ISO** is under active development and **may soon** be shared privately with our most engaged contributors. This version will focus on testing and improving core features, and we need your help to make it the best it can be.
