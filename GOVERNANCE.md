# ASIOS‚Ñ¢ Governance & Control Framework  
**KarLex AI, Inc. (Delaware C-Corp)**

This document establishes governance, licensing, contribution guidelines, and release processes for **ASIOS‚Ñ¢**, aligning open-core community principles with corporate oversight under Delaware law. With **full transparency**, the entire 12-phase **ASIOS‚Ñ¢** [Architecture](https://github.com/asi-os/asios-docs/edit/main/GOVERNANCE.md) is open-source, ensuring community participation at every stage.

While **ASIOS‚Ñ¢** follows an open-source model, **KarLex AI, Inc.** retains the ability to develop and integrate proprietary, enterprise-grade, and security-specific components. These proprietary enhancements can include specialized tools, advanced security features, and enterprise support services, similar to how Red Hat and Ubuntu offer both open-source foundations and additional commercial offerings. This hybrid approach allows **KarLex AI** to meet the needs of both the open-source community and enterprise customers seeking tailored, secure, and robust solutions.
